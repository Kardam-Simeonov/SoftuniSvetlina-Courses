The method \u0060Permute\u0060 is the public interface that takes an array of integers as input and returns a list of all permutations.\n\nThe \u0060Permute\u0060 method initializes an empty list of permutations and calls the \u0060GeneratePermutations\u0060 method, which is a recursive helper method that generates all permutations of the array.\n\nThe \u0060GeneratePermutations\u0060 method takes three parameters: the array of integers, the current index \u0060start\u0060, and the list of permutations. The recursion base case is when \u0060start\u0060 equals the length of the array, which means a permutation is completed and it\u0027s added to the list of permutations.\n\nIf \u0060start\u0060 is less than the length of the array, the method iterates over the array from the \u0060start\u0060 index to the end of the array. For each index \u0060i\u0060, it swaps the elements at \u0060start\u0060 and \u0060i\u0060, recursively calls \u0060GeneratePermutations\u0060 with \u0060start \u002B 1\u0060, and then swaps the elements back. This backtracking ensures that all permutations are generated.\n\nThe \u0060Swap\u0060 method is a helper method that swaps the elements of the array at two specified indices.\n\nThis solution uses the backtracking technique to generate all permutations. It ensures that each permutation is unique because it only swaps distinct elements. The time complexity is O(n*n!) because there are n! permutations and it takes O(n) time to generate each permutation.","Type":0,"Status":1,"FollowUpPrompts":["Can you explain the backtracking technique?","How can I optimize this solution?"]},"SelectedFunctionName":"Explain","LoggedSkillInvocations":null,"ThreadName":null}

We have \u0060n\u0060 chairs and we want to arrange \u0060k\u0060 of them in a row for our guests. Here\u0027s how our game (or algorithm) works:\n\n1. **Start of the game**: We start with all the chairs in a pile and an empty row in front of us.\n\n2. **First move**: We pick a chair from the pile (let\u0027s say the red one) and put it at the start of our row. This is like the first step in our algorithm.\n\n3. **Next moves**: Now, we want to see all the different ways we can arrange the remaining chairs after the red one. So, we pick another chair (let\u0027s say the blue one) and put it next to the red one. This is like calling our game (or algorithm) again but now starting from the second position.\n\n4. **Changing the order**: After we\u0027ve seen all the ways to arrange the chairs with the red one at the start, we want to see what happens if we put a different chair at the start. So, we put the red one back into the pile and take out the blue one and put it at the start of our row. This is like the second step in our algorithm.\n\n5. **Repeating the game**: We keep repeating steps 3 and 4 for each chair in the pile. This is like the loop in our algorithm that goes over each position in our list.\n\n6. **Finishing a round**: When there are no more chairs left in the pile, we have a complete row of chairs. This is like when we\u0027ve gone through all positions in our list.\n\n7. **Remembering the round**: We take a picture of our row of chairs and put it in our album. This is like adding the current arrangement to our list of all arrangements.\n\n8. **End of the game**: After we\u0027ve taken a picture of every possible row of chairs, our game is over. This is like when our algorithm has gone through all positions and added all arrangements to the list.\n\nSo, our game (or algorithm) is like playing with chairs and finding out all the different ways we can arrange them in a row. We do this by starting with one chair, then seeing all the arrangements with the next chair, and so on until we\u0027ve gone through all the chairs.

If it is, it means a valid combination of \u0060k\u0060 elements has been found, so it adds \u0060current\u0060 to \u0060results\u0060 and returns.\n\n4. **Generating Combinations**: If the size of \u0060current\u0060 is less than \u0060k\u0060, it means more elements are needed to form a valid combination. So, it starts a loop from the \u0060start\u0060 index to the end of \u0060nums\u0060, and for each index \u0060i\u0060, it adds \u0060nums[i]\u0060 to \u0060current\u0060, and makes a recursive call to \u0060Backtrack\u0060 with \u0060start\u0060 set to \u0060i \u002B 1\u0060 and the updated \u0060current\u0060. This is to generate all combinations that start with the elements currently in \u0060current\u0060.\n\n5. **Backtracking**: After the recursive call, it removes the last element from \u0060current\u0060. This is the backtracking step that undoes the previous choice, so that the next iteration of the loop can choose the next element.\n\n6. **Returning the Results**: After the backtracking process is complete, the \u0060Combine\u0060 function returns \u0060results\u0060 which now contains all possible combinations of \u0060k\u0060 elements from the set of \u0060n\u0060 elements.\n\nThis algorithm uses the concept of backtracking to generate all combinations, which is a common approach for solving combinatorial problems.
